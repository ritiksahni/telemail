This is an open correspondence with Professor Helen De Cruz , the Danforth Chair in the Humanities at Saint Louis University. You can read her original open letter to me here.

Dear Professor De Cruz
Thank you for writing me an open letter, and I’m glad my work impacts you and your students. To break the ice, here’s a summary of my current situation. I’m about to enter my Honours year at the University of Melbourne after receiving a B. A. in French and Literature. Down the road, I’m considering pivoting into philosophy through a thesis on a Wittgensteinian reading of Beckett. In the future, I will specialize in 20th Century critical theory and devise a new model of education to steer the discourse away from the dehumanizing, institutionalized learning we have now.
In light of some good-spirited info-dumping (like you did in your letter), I want to use this letter to answer a question you posed in a thread a while ago. You mentioned that students in your class are averse to reading the source material you’ve assigned and wanted to find new ways to keep them engaged. But as I wrote to you in that email thread last night, getting people interested in reading is like looking at the grammar of our native language. We must force ourselves to look at the mechanics of what we took for granted, in this case, our love for philosophy and books, and try to impart that to students. So, here's my best attempt to offer insight from my recent readings.
Let’s start with an observation: what is the first question students ask when you assign a reading piece? It’s never: will this deepen my understanding or enrich my life somehow? But always: will this be on the exam?  Academically minded people (myself included) are under the illusion that we are still living in a utopia where learning is hailed as a virtue while scholars are revered as cultural icons. But in reality, we’re dealing with an entirely different generation of learners with radically different priorities.
I recently started a survey of the Frankfurt School thinkers (Benjamin, Adorno, Horkheimer, etc.) and stumbled upon a book called: Dialectic of Enlightenment. The book's first few chapters shone a light on the decline of the humanities in the 21st Century. For Adorno and Horkheimer, the European Enlightenment wasn’t just a movement that liberated human beings from fear and [installed] them as masters (Adorno and Horkheimer 1), but it constituted a radicalized fear of the mythical. The language of science and statistics [allowed] nothing to remain outside, since the mere idea of the “outside” is the real source of fear (11).
There’s no clearer example of this than the clash between the Analytic School vs. The Continental School. Before the Second World War, a group of Oxford young men set out to trash metaphysics. With the blessings of Frege and Russell , they set out to reinvent philosophy with the tools of formal logic and verification principles. Most notably, A. J. Ayer, in his work: Language, Truth and Logic, essentially argued that there is no truth beyond what can be verified scientifically or logically. His followers later adopted a derogatory label: the boo hurrah theory, to describe any philosophical concept that dealt with the ethical and grouped them under emotivism.
This is what Francis Bacon described as the search for an effective procedure (2) instead of satisfaction, which [people] call [the pursuit of] truth (Bacon 281). Knowledge nowadays, as it is still basking in the twilight of the Enlightenment and Analytic Philosophy, made its goal about the discovery of particulars not revealed before, for the better endowment and help of man’s life (281). In other words, it values practicality over understanding. And there shall be [no] desire to reveal mystery (Adorno and Horkheimer 2).
Combing back to the question: will this be on the exam? This question is not as innocent as it may seem but is a symptom of a larger problem. For students, the set syllabus turned into a new procedure that will carry them to a quantifiable goal: getting a degree, graduating on time and heading into a profitable career. The emphasis here is not on exploration nor confronting the unknown (which is one of the aims of philosophical investigations) but on quantifying something that cannot be quantified. And the humanities departments, bending to the pressures of their STEM counterparts, are trying to formalize their curriculum into a science by getting students to read excerpts instead of entire treatises, focusing on assignments instead of intellectual adventures and grading the non-quantifiable quality of critical thinking. This systematization of thought introduced the language of science into philosophy & the liberal arts, and through reinforcing the power of this language, ideas [become] superfluous (17) because the myth of science convinced us that there is no more mystery left in the universe.
So, under this paradigm, it is no wonder that students are often unmotivated to read philosophical texts. Investigations of Descartes turn into amusing dinner table conversations, and les écrivains engagés seem like diehard idealists of the past. And, as you mentioned, there’s a recent collapse in the academic job market, and it is not an accident. A genuine desire for understanding is almost antithetical to modern definitions of success, rendering the academic job market an oxymoron. This is why most philosophy undergrads pivot into law, science or engineering, and the current education system is doing everything possible to stifle philosophical inquiry. This is painfully clear from the recent fee hike of Australian Universities that raised the tuition fee of Liberal Arts degrees by 113% under the guise of “increasing the employment rate of graduates”.
But as an eternal optimist, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. From what I can see, despite the fee hikes and social pressures to succeed in a more traditional career, more students are choosing to study the humanities than ever. As you mentioned in your open letter, public intellectuals like Jordan Peterson still make waves by re-introducing authors like Dostoyevsky and Nietzsche back to the modern discourse despite their loose grasp of philosophical ideas. This is a symptom of Stage Yellow thinking from the Spiral Dynamics model developed by Don Beck and Christopher Cowen (based on the Emergent Cyclical Theory of Clare Graves).
Individuals in Stage Yellow slowly emerge from the autonomous, material-driven worldview into a more integral & systematic worldview, and a renewed interest in ideas facilitates this. More and more academics are choosing to leave the academic system in favour of spreading their ideas through alternative mediums (Erik Hoel  is a really good example of this: Goodbye Academia, Hello Substack [ https://substack.com/redirect/fb2852e6-41ec-4a56-a9e7-5589abccd53d?j=eyJ1IjoiajJjaXEifQ.rjSOykxAwwHuo6hFSjllgx3O5r-XE7Cy9kSjJ21nqzY ]), and from your recent public philosophy work, I feel like there’s definitely a Renaissance of ideas on the horizon.
To conclude this letter, I want to return to Adorno and Horkheimer. The thesis of Dialectic of Enlightenment is that the opposition between Myth and Enlightenment is false. As they wrote in the text: 
“Myth is already enlightenment, and enlightenment reverts to mythology”. 
And to answer the original question: how do we get students interested in philosophy, we need to actively encourage students (in my case, my audience) to doubt the myth of the mathematical and scientific discourse and open up the window for confronting the unknown. And instead of framing history as a chronology in favour of the present, we need to discuss history in terms of a dialectical progression, in that there are still questions in philosophy worth pondering, mysteries we don’t have answers to and serious ethical questions (especially with the recent emergence of Artificial Intelligence) that the language of science cannot answer. 
If students feel like they are on the precipice of discovery again, they can’t help but to branch off and discover ideas and books for themselves. Like Elizabeth Anscombe once wrote: 
“No second-rate philosophy is any good. One must start from scratch & it takes a very long time to reach scratch.” 
To teach philosophy well is to help students reach scratch by restoring the mysteries of ethics, metaphysics and epistemology. And I look forward to doing this with your blessing in my future work.
Yours
